## Question 1

1. The sample selection model. A researcher aims to gain insight in the potential earnings of the non-employed. (In the data, the non-employed can be identified by a missing value for the earnings variable). She realizes that the sample of observed wages may be subject to sample selection.

    (a) Run an OLS regression for log-earnings on schooling, age, and age squared. Present the results and comment on the estimates.
    
    ```{r}
    read_csv("./Data/logEarnings.csv")
    ```
